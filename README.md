# BillerFX

**It is an invoicing application for restaurants and hotels developed in JavaFX.**

* Maintains database in MySql hence multiple applications can be installed, sharing the information of clients and orders.
* Keeps track of the orders received from individual tables and generates a printable pdf invoice (automatically calculates the discounts and taxes) in the end.
* Manages a history of the visitors, their visit frequency, favourite table and items (based on order history). It also keeps track of the quantity of items sold (weekly/monthly) and specially for drinks it notifies how much volume of a particular drink is remaining.
* Supports emailing the invoice to the client so that papers are saved.
